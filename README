Problem	:	Design and implement a 3D robot and make it dance using OpenGl.
Site	:	http://www.agarwalchirag.wordpress.com

-This project aims at creating a 3D robot using the polygon primitives in OpenGl and glut libraries. 

-The bot is assigned a material.

-Four different light sources are craeted at different locations and are triggered randomly to give a better look to the dance.

-The bot is animated to dance to some basic steps. 

-The background has walls and a dance floor. Appropriate texture mapping is incorporated to each of these planes.

-Along with the above, the sound is implemented in the same program using the windows libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE :

The code works only on Windows operating system. It uses the following libraries :

-windows.h
-mmsystem.h

Make sure to include the "libwinmm.a" file in the project parameters. I've used the DevC++ IDE.
